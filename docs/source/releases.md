# Relase Notes

Detailled release notes are available at: [https://github.com/complextissue/pytximport/releases](https://github.com/complextissue/pytximport/releases)

Note, that `pytximport` follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Currently, `pytximport` is still at version 0.x, meaning that while it can be used for real world data, you should not expect the API (e.g., parameter names and defaults) to stay consistent after updates. Once we reach version 1.0.0, `pytximport` will follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH scheme outlined in the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) guidelines.
